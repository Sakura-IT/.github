Welcome! We are a small company, specialising in hardware and software development for retro computer systems.

Even if our products are targetting retro computers, we belive that they should be built using most modern technologies available (high performance, low power, envorimentally friendly components, lead free solder, etc.).

To support innovation within the retro community, we provide schematics, board layout files and CPLD cores of our products under open source licenses. This means that anyone can build the product themselves!
